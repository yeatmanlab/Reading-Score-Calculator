# Reading Assessment Scoring Web Application
This is a web application that can calculate scores from various reading assessments based on raw input .csv files. 

It currently supports the following assessments: 

* TOWRE SWE
* TOWRE PDE
* CTOPP MFD
* CTOPP RDN
* CTOPP RLN
* Please note that WJ has to be done through the WJ dashboard (wjscore.com.) This form can be used to calculate percentile once the WJ standard score is obtained from running the report. 

If you have any questions or find an error then please email Willy at willyc@stanford.edu and cc Jasmine at jasetran@stanford.edu.
